"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous 
indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and 
demoralized by the charms 
o
f
 pleasu
 re of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pai
 n and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty thro
 ugh weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil an
 d pain. These cases are perfectly s
 imple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice i
 s untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, e
 very pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances an
 d owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur tha
 t pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always ho
 lds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other gr
 eater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
